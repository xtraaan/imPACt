# imPACt

To compile the code, open Visual Studio. Open the imPACt.sln solution file to open the project. If on Windows, right click imPACt.Android and click "Deploy" and the application will run on the default android emulator that is installed. If on MacOS, right click imPACt.Android to run the application on an android emulator or right click imPACt.iOS to run the application on an iOS emulator. You must have an emulator already downloaded. For example, we used the Android Studio emulator and the Xcode emulator to deploy the application.
